/**
 * 🔴 A LOCAL SHELL AND CI THAT INSTALL DIFFERENT TOOLCHAINS MAKE A GREEN RUN
 * MEAN NOTHING.
 *
 * `flake.nix` is what a contributor's shell installs (`nix develop` / direnv);
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is what the merge gate installs. When those two
 * disagree, "it passes locally" stops being evidence about the gate and the
 * gate stops being evidence about anyone's machine — and nothing announces the
 * split, because both sides stay green while testing different things.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. Before the flake landed, this workflow pinned
 * `node-version: '22'` as a literal and installed with npm, while no flake
 * existed at all — so there was no reproducible shell to disagree with, and
 * the first one written would have silently disagreed with CI.
 *
 * The two pins are handled asymmetrically, on purpose:
 *
 *   node — ONE authority, `.nvmrc`. flake.nix reads it with `builtins.readFile`
 *          and CI reads it via `actions/setup-node`'s `node-version-file`.
 *          Neither restates a version, so neither can drift. What this file
 *          guards is that the arrangement is still WIRED THAT WAY: a future
 *          edit that hardcodes `node-version: 22` back into the workflow would
 *          reintroduce exactly the split described above, and nothing else
 *          would notice.
 *
 *   pnpm — TWO statements, because `pnpm/action-setup` reads only its own
 *          `version:` input or `package.json`'s `packageManager` field, and
 *          adding `packageManager` would change what the PLATFORM's builder
 *          does, since it runs against that same file. So the major is written
 *          down twice and asserted equal here. This is the assertion that
 *          actually compares two values; the node ones assert a structure.
 *
 * Read off disk rather than imported: `tsconfig.json` scopes `include` to
 * `src` (plus `vite.config.ts`), and `import.meta.url` makes the paths
 * independent of the runner's working directory.
 *
 * Every extractor below THROWS when the shape it expects is missing, rather
 * than returning undefined. A guard that silently passes once someone deletes
 * the step it inspects is worse than no guard: it reads as coverage while
 * providing none.
