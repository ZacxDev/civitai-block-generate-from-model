      # Node has exactly ONE authority: `.nvmrc`, read here and consumed by CI
      # via `actions/setup-node`'s `node-version-file`. Restating the version
      # in this file is what lets the flake and CI drift, so it isn't restated.
      # A bare MAJOR is deliberate — a patch pin would drift the moment nixpkgs
      # moved `nodejs_24` under us, and neither consumer cares about the patch.
      #
      # pnpm cannot use that trick: `pnpm/action-setup` reads either its own
      # `version:` input or `package.json`'s `packageManager` field, and adding
      # `packageManager` here would change what the PLATFORM's own builder does
      # (it runs against this same package.json), a blast radius this repo's
      # dev ergonomics do not justify. So the pnpm major is stated in both
      # places and `src/toolchain-lockstep.test.ts` asserts the two agree — a
      # red test rather than a silent divergence.
